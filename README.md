# ðŸ“Š Spotify Top Songs 2023 - Power BI Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that analyzes Spotify's top-streamed tracks from **2018 to 2023**. The dashboard provides insights into **streaming trends, track attributes, and artist performances** using a **refined dataset with album covers**.  

## Data Source  
ðŸ“Œ **Kaggle Dataset**: [Top Spotify Songs 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023?resource=download)  

## Workflow  

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - The raw dataset (`Spotify_2023.csv`) was obtained from **Kaggle**.  

2. **Data Enrichment**  
   - A Python script (`Getting_album_cover_script.ipynb`) was created to fetch **album cover URLs** for each track.  

3. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**  
   - The **updated dataset** (`updated_dataset_with_album_cover.csv`) was loaded into **Power BI**.  
   - Missing values were handled, and **necessary transformations** were applied.  

4. **Dashboard Development**  
   - A **visually appealing and interactive Power BI dashboard** was built to analyze:  
     - **Top streamed tracks & artists**  
     - **Annual & monthly streaming trends**  
     - **Track attributes (energy, danceability, valence, etc.)**  
     - **Track releases over time**
